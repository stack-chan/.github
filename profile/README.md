## 🤖 Meet Stack-chan!

Hello! Stack-chan is a palm-sized, super-kawaii open-source robot. Our motto is: "A communication robot, in your hands." Stack-chan combines the versatility of the "M5Stack" IoT module with the affectionate Japanese honorific "-chan." Being open-source is at our core, and Stack-chan invites creators and enthusiasts from around the world to participate in our vibrant community.

## 🌏 A Thriving Global Community

Our community is active on platforms like Twitter and Discord, where daily interactions bring new innovations to Stack-chan’s development. Unlike traditional robot products managed by specific companies or individuals, we foster a decentralized environment where "everyone is both a developer and a user." We mainly operate in Japanese but with a growing international presence, we are also active in other languages. Join us on this journey!

## 🚀 Stack-chan Activities

Since its inception on July 2, 2021, Stack-chan has been celebrated through birthday parties, interactive events, and exhibitions at Tokyo Maker Faire, showcasing our collaborative spirit.
